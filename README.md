## I was waiting for you ✨
Hi there, my name is Caio Alexandre (pronunciation: `k-ay-oh`), I'm a developer looking for new adventures in the cosmos. ☄

### Skillset
This is my current skillset, remembering that this list is always expanding!

| Technology | Skill level  |
| ---------- | -----------  |
|   Python   |  Proficient  |
|   NodeJS   | Considerable |
|   Express  | Considerable |
|    Rust    |   Minimal    |
|    C++     |   Minimal    |
| PostgreSQL | Considerable |
|   SQLite   |   Minimal    |
|   MongoDB  |   Minimal    |
|    Java    |   Minimal    |
|    Git     | Considerable |
    Linux    |   Minimal    |

As you can see, I am still a junior programmer, with a great desire for knowledge and never being limited.

### Learning intentions
Here is the list of technologies that I intend to improve to become proficient, also remembering that this list can be changed according to my needs!

| Technology |
| ---------- |
|   NodeJS   |
|   Express  |
|    Rust    |
|     C      |
|    C++     |
| PostgreSQL |
|  GDScript  |
|    Git     |
|   Linux    |

### My "playstyle"
I'm not a programmer who likes badly made and disorganized code. Whenever possible, I optimize my codes (limiting myself only to my knowledge of the language) and always follow the styling conventions of the adopted language. I currently use VSCode to code but I've had experiences with PyCharm, Sublime Text 3 and Atom. I have experiences with Linux but never really used it (as much as I really wanted to).
